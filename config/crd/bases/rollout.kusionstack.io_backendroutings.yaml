                                          entries with an equivalent header name MUST be ignored. Due to the
                                          case-insensitivity of header names, "foo" and "Foo" are considered
                                          equivalent.


                                          When a header is repeated in an HTTP request, it is
                                          implementation-specific behavior as to how this is represented.
                                          Generally, proxies should follow the guidance from the RFC:

                                          exact string match. (See
                                          https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-2.7.3).


                                          If multiple entries specify equivalent query param names, only the first
                                          entry with an equivalent name MUST be considered for a match. Subsequent
                                          entries with an equivalent query param name MUST be ignored.


                                          If a query param is repeated in an HTTP request, the behavior is
                                          purposely left undefined, since different data planes have different
                                          capabilities. However, it is *recommended* that implementations should
                                          match against the first value of the param if the data plane supports it,
                                          as this behavior is expected in other load balancing contexts outside of
                                          the Gateway API.


                                          Users SHOULD NOT route traffic based on repeated query params to guard
                                          themselves against potential differences in the implementations.

                              to mean that the endpoint is not terminating.
