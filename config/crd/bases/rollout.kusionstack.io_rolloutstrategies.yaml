                                Filters define the filters that are applied to requests that match
                                this rule.


                                The effects of ordering of multiple behaviors are currently unspecified.
                                This can change in the future based on feedback during the alpha stage.


                                Conformance-levels at this level are defined based on the type of filter:


                                - ALL core filters MUST be supported by all implementations.
                                - Implementers are encouraged to support extended filters.
                                - Implementation-specific custom filters have no API guarantees across
                                  implementations.


                                Specifying the same filter multiple times is not supported unless explicitly
                                indicated in the filter.


                                All filters are expected to be compatible with each other except for the
                                URLRewrite and RequestRedirect filters, which may not be combined. If an
                                implementation can not support other combinations of filters, they must clearly
                                document that limitation. In cases where incompatible or unsupported
                                filters are specified and cause the `Accepted` condition to be set to status
                                `False`, implementations may use the `IncompatibleFilters` reason to specify
                                this configuration error.

                                              match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                              to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                              of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".


                                              Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                              matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                              in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                              ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                              match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.


                                              ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                              Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                              the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                                          If no port is specified, the redirect port MUST be derived using the
                                          following rules:


                                          * If redirect scheme is not-empty, the redirect port MUST be the well-known
                                            port associated with the redirect scheme. Specifically "http" to port 80
                                            and "https" to port 443. If the redirect scheme does not have a
                                            well-known port, the listener port of the Gateway SHOULD be used.
                                          * If redirect scheme is empty, the redirect port MUST be the Gateway
                                            Listener port.


                                          Implementations SHOULD NOT add the port number in the 'Location'
                                          header in the following cases:


                                          * A Location header that will use HTTP (whether that is determined via
                                            the Listener protocol or the Scheme field) _and_ use port 80.
                                          * A Location header that will use HTTPS (whether that is determined via
                                            the Listener protocol or the Scheme field) _and_ use port 443.

                                        "Support: Core" in this package, e.g. "RequestHeaderModifier". All
                                        implementations must support core filters.


                                      - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                        "Support: Extended" in this package, e.g. "RequestMirror". Implementers
                                        are encouraged to support extended filters.


                                      - Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by
                                        specific vendors.
                                        In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
                                        implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
                                        conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
                                        is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` should be set to
                                        "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.


                                      Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
                                      extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.


                                      If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                                      MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
                                      that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.


                                      Note that values may be added to this enum, implementations
                                      must ensure that unknown values will not cause a crash.


                                      Unknown values here must result in the implementation setting the
                                      Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`, with a
                                      Reason of `UnsupportedValue`.

                                              ReplacePrefixMatch specifies the value with which to replace the prefix
                                              match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                              to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                              of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".


                                              Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                              matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                              in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                              ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                              match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.


                                              ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                              Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                              the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                                HTTP requests. Each match is independent, i.e. this rule will be matched
                                if **any** one of the matches is satisfied.


                                For example, take the following matches configuration:


                                ```
                                matches:
                                - path:
                                    value: "/foo"
                                  headers:
                                  - name: "version"
                                    value: "v2"
                                - path:
                                    value: "/v2/foo"
                                ```


                                For a request to match against this rule, a request must satisfy
                                EITHER of the two conditions:


                                - path prefixed with `/foo` AND contains the header `version: v2`
                                - path prefix of `/v2/foo`


                                See the documentation for HTTPRouteMatch on how to specify multiple
                                match conditions that should be ANDed together.


                                If no matches are specified, the default is a prefix
                                path match on "/", which has the effect of matching every
                                HTTP request.


                                Proxy or Load Balancer routing configuration generated from HTTPRoutes
                                MUST prioritize matches based on the following criteria, continuing on
                                ties. Across all rules specified on applicable Routes, precedence must be
                                given to the match having:


                                * "Exact" path match.
                                * "Prefix" path match with largest number of characters.
                                * Method match.
                                * Largest number of header matches.
                                * Largest number of query param matches.


                                Note: The precedence of RegularExpression path matches are implementation-specific.


                                If ties still exist across multiple Routes, matching precedence MUST be
                                determined in order of the following criteria, continuing on ties:


                                * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp.
                                * The Route appearing first in alphabetical order by
                                  "{namespace}/{name}".


                                If ties still exist within an HTTPRoute, matching precedence MUST be granted
                                to the FIRST matching rule (in list order) with a match meeting the above
                                criteria.

                                parent a request is coming from, a HTTP 404 status code MUST be returned.

                                            case-insensitivity of header names, "foo" and "Foo" are considered
                                            equivalent.


                                            When a header is repeated in an HTTP request, it is
                                            implementation-specific behavior as to how this is represented.

                                            If multiple entries specify equivalent query param names, only the first
                                            entry with an equivalent name MUST be considered for a match. Subsequent
                                            entries with an equivalent query param name MUST be ignored.


                                            If a query param is repeated in an HTTP request, the behavior is
                                            purposely left undefined, since different data planes have different
                                            capabilities. However, it is *recommended* that implementations should
                                            match against the first value of the param if the data plane supports it,
                                            as this behavior is expected in other load balancing contexts outside of
                                            the Gateway API.


                                            Users SHOULD NOT route traffic based on repeated query params to guard
                                            themselves against potential differences in the implementations.

                                    this rule.


                                    The effects of ordering of multiple behaviors are currently unspecified.
                                    This can change in the future based on feedback during the alpha stage.


                                    Conformance-levels at this level are defined based on the type of filter:


                                    - ALL core filters MUST be supported by all implementations.
                                    - Implementers are encouraged to support extended filters.
                                    - Implementation-specific custom filters have no API guarantees across
                                      implementations.


                                    Specifying the same filter multiple times is not supported unless explicitly
                                    indicated in the filter.


                                    All filters are expected to be compatible with each other except for the
                                    URLRewrite and RequestRedirect filters, which may not be combined. If an
                                    implementation can not support other combinations of filters, they must clearly
                                    document that limitation. In cases where incompatible or unsupported
                                    filters are specified and cause the `Accepted` condition to be set to status
                                    `False`, implementations may use the `IncompatibleFilters` reason to specify
                                    this configuration error.

                                              BackendRef references a resource where mirrored requests are sent.


                                              Mirrored requests must be sent only to a single destination endpoint
                                              within this BackendRef, irrespective of how many endpoints are present
                                              within this BackendRef.


                                              If the referent cannot be found, this BackendRef is invalid and must be
                                              dropped from the Gateway. The controller must ensure the "ResolvedRefs"
                                              condition on the Route status is set to `status: False` and not configure
                                              this backend in the underlying implementation.


                                              If there is a cross-namespace reference to an *existing* object
                                              that is not allowed by a ReferenceGrant, the controller must ensure the
                                              "ResolvedRefs"  condition on the Route is set to `status: False`,
                                              with the "RefNotPermitted" reason and not configure this backend in the
                                              underlying implementation.


                                              In either error case, the Message of the `ResolvedRefs` Condition
                                              should be used to provide more detail about the problem.

                                                  of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".


                                                  Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                                  matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                                  in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                                  ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                                  match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.


                                                  ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                                  Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                                  the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                                              If no port is specified, the redirect port MUST be derived using the
                                              following rules:


                                              * If redirect scheme is not-empty, the redirect port MUST be the well-known
                                                port associated with the redirect scheme. Specifically "http" to port 80
                                                and "https" to port 443. If the redirect scheme does not have a
                                                well-known port, the listener port of the Gateway SHOULD be used.
                                              * If redirect scheme is empty, the redirect port MUST be the Gateway
                                                Listener port.


                                              Implementations SHOULD NOT add the port number in the 'Location'
                                              header in the following cases:


                                              * A Location header that will use HTTP (whether that is determined via
                                                the Listener protocol or the Scheme field) _and_ use port 80.
                                              * A Location header that will use HTTPS (whether that is determined via
                                                the Listener protocol or the Scheme field) _and_ use port 443.

                                          Type identifies the type of filter to apply. As with other API fields,
                                          types are classified into three conformance levels:


                                          - Core: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                            "Support: Core" in this package, e.g. "RequestHeaderModifier". All
                                            implementations must support core filters.


                                          - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                            "Support: Extended" in this package, e.g. "RequestMirror". Implementers
                                            are encouraged to support extended filters.


                                          - Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by
                                            specific vendors.
                                            In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
                                            implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
                                            conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
                                            is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` should be set to
                                            "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.


                                          Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
                                          extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.


                                          If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                                          MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
                                          that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.


                                          Note that values may be added to this enum, implementations
                                          must ensure that unknown values will not cause a crash.


                                          Unknown values here must result in the implementation setting the
                                          Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`, with a
                                          Reason of `UnsupportedValue`.
                                        enum:
                                        - RequestHeaderModifier

                                                  ReplacePrefixMatch specifies the value with which to replace the prefix
                                                  match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                                  to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                                  of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".


                                                  Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                                  matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                                  in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                                  ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                                  match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.


                                                  ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                                  Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in

                                    Matches define conditions used for matching the rule against incoming
                                    HTTP requests. Each match is independent, i.e. this rule will be matched
                                    if **any** one of the matches is satisfied.


                                    For example, take the following matches configuration:


                                    ```
                                    matches:
                                    - path:
                                        value: "/foo"
                                      headers:
                                      - name: "version"
                                        value: "v2"
                                    - path:
                                        value: "/v2/foo"
                                    ```


                                    For a request to match against this rule, a request must satisfy
                                    EITHER of the two conditions:


                                    - path prefixed with `/foo` AND contains the header `version: v2`
                                    - path prefix of `/v2/foo`


                                    See the documentation for HTTPRouteMatch on how to specify multiple
                                    match conditions that should be ANDed together.


                                    If no matches are specified, the default is a prefix
                                    path match on "/", which has the effect of matching every
                                    HTTP request.


                                    Proxy or Load Balancer routing configuration generated from HTTPRoutes
                                    MUST prioritize matches based on the following criteria, continuing on
                                    ties. Across all rules specified on applicable Routes, precedence must be
                                    given to the match having:


                                    * "Exact" path match.
                                    * "Prefix" path match with largest number of characters.
                                    * Method match.
                                    * Largest number of header matches.
                                    * Largest number of query param matches.


                                    Note: The precedence of RegularExpression path matches are implementation-specific.


                                    If ties still exist across multiple Routes, matching precedence MUST be
                                    determined in order of the following criteria, continuing on ties:


                                    * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp.
                                    * The Route appearing first in alphabetical order by
                                      "{namespace}/{name}".


                                    If ties still exist within an HTTPRoute, matching precedence MUST be granted
                                    to the FIRST matching rule (in list order) with a match meeting the above
                                    criteria.


                                    When no rules matching a request have been successfully attached to the
                                    parent a request is coming from, a HTTP 404 status code MUST be returned.

                                                Name is the name of the HTTP Header to be matched. Name matching MUST be
                                                case insensitive. (See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2).


                                                If multiple entries specify equivalent header names, only the first
                                                entry with an equivalent name MUST be considered for a match. Subsequent
                                                entries with an equivalent header name MUST be ignored. Due to the
                                                case-insensitivity of header names, "foo" and "Foo" are considered
                                                equivalent.


                                                When a header is repeated in an HTTP request, it is
                                                implementation-specific behavior as to how this is represented.
                                                Generally, proxies should follow the guidance from the RFC:

                                                Name is the name of the HTTP query param to be matched. This must be an
                                                exact string match. (See
                                                https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-2.7.3).


                                                If multiple entries specify equivalent query param names, only the first
                                                entry with an equivalent name MUST be considered for a match. Subsequent
                                                entries with an equivalent query param name MUST be ignored.


                                                If a query param is repeated in an HTTP request, the behavior is
                                                purposely left undefined, since different data planes have different
                                                capabilities. However, it is *recommended* that implementations should
                                                match against the first value of the param if the data plane supports it,
                                                as this behavior is expected in other load balancing contexts outside of
                                                the Gateway API.


                                                Users SHOULD NOT route traffic based on repeated query params to guard
                                                themselves against potential differences in the implementations.

                          Filters define the filters that are applied to requests that match
                          this rule.


                          The effects of ordering of multiple behaviors are currently unspecified.
                          This can change in the future based on feedback during the alpha stage.


                          Conformance-levels at this level are defined based on the type of filter:


                          - ALL core filters MUST be supported by all implementations.
                          - Implementers are encouraged to support extended filters.
                          - Implementation-specific custom filters have no API guarantees across
                            implementations.


                          Specifying the same filter multiple times is not supported unless explicitly
                          indicated in the filter.


                          All filters are expected to be compatible with each other except for the
                          URLRewrite and RequestRedirect filters, which may not be combined. If an

                                    that is not allowed by a ReferenceGrant, the controller must ensure the
                                    "ResolvedRefs"  condition on the Route is set to `status: False`,
                                    with the "RefNotPermitted" reason and not configure this backend in the
                                    underlying implementation.


                                    In either error case, the Message of the `ResolvedRefs` Condition
                                    should be used to provide more detail about the problem.

                                        match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request

                                        of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".


                                        Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                        matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                        in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                        ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                        match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.


                                        ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                        Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                        the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                                      port associated with the redirect scheme. Specifically "http" to port 80
                                      and "https" to port 443. If the redirect scheme does not have a
                                      well-known port, the listener port of the Gateway SHOULD be used.
                                    * If redirect scheme is empty, the redirect port MUST be the Gateway
                                      Listener port.


                                    Implementations SHOULD NOT add the port number in the 'Location'
                                    header in the following cases:


                                    * A Location header that will use HTTP (whether that is determined via
                                      the Listener protocol or the Scheme field) _and_ use port 80.
                                    * A Location header that will use HTTPS (whether that is determined via
                                      the Listener protocol or the Scheme field) _and_ use port 443.

                                Type identifies the type of filter to apply. As with other API fields,
                                types are classified into three conformance levels:


                                - Core: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                  "Support: Core" in this package, e.g. "RequestHeaderModifier". All
                                  implementations must support core filters.


                                - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                  "Support: Extended" in this package, e.g. "RequestMirror". Implementers
                                  are encouraged to support extended filters.


                                - Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by
                                  specific vendors.
                                  In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
                                  implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
                                  conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
                                  is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` should be set to
                                  "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.


                                Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
                                extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.


                                If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                                MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
                                that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.


                                Note that values may be added to this enum, implementations
                                must ensure that unknown values will not cause a crash.


                                Unknown values here must result in the implementation setting the
                                Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`, with a
                                Reason of `UnsupportedValue`.
                              enum:
                              - RequestHeaderModifier

                                        ReplaceFullPath specifies the value with which to replace the full path
                                        of a request during a rewrite or redirect.

                                      description: |-
                                        ReplacePrefixMatch specifies the value with which to replace the prefix
                                        match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                        to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                        of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".


                                        Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                        matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                        in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                        ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                        match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.


                                        ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                        Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                        the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                          Matches define conditions used for matching the rule against incoming
                          HTTP requests. Each match is independent, i.e. this rule will be matched
                          if **any** one of the matches is satisfied.


                          For example, take the following matches configuration:


                          ```
                          matches:
                          - path:
                              value: "/foo"
                            headers:
                            - name: "version"
                              value: "v2"
                          - path:
                              value: "/v2/foo"
                          ```


                          For a request to match against this rule, a request must satisfy
                          EITHER of the two conditions:


                          - path prefixed with `/foo` AND contains the header `version: v2`
                          - path prefix of `/v2/foo`


                          See the documentation for HTTPRouteMatch on how to specify multiple
                          match conditions that should be ANDed together.


                          If no matches are specified, the default is a prefix
                          path match on "/", which has the effect of matching every
                          HTTP request.


                          Proxy or Load Balancer routing configuration generated from HTTPRoutes
                          MUST prioritize matches based on the following criteria, continuing on
                          ties. Across all rules specified on applicable Routes, precedence must be
                          given to the match having:


                          * "Exact" path match.
                          * "Prefix" path match with largest number of characters.
                          * Method match.
                          * Largest number of header matches.
                          * Largest number of query param matches.


                          Note: The precedence of RegularExpression path matches are implementation-specific.


                          If ties still exist across multiple Routes, matching precedence MUST be
                          determined in order of the following criteria, continuing on ties:


                          * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp.
                          * The Route appearing first in alphabetical order by
                            "{namespace}/{name}".


                          If ties still exist within an HTTPRoute, matching precedence MUST be granted
                          to the FIRST matching rule (in list order) with a match meeting the above
                          criteria.


                          When no rules matching a request have been successfully attached to the
                          parent a request is coming from, a HTTP 404 status code MUST be returned.

                                      If multiple entries specify equivalent header names, only the first
                                      entry with an equivalent name MUST be considered for a match. Subsequent
                                      entries with an equivalent header name MUST be ignored. Due to the
                                      case-insensitivity of header names, "foo" and "Foo" are considered
                                      equivalent.

                                      implementation-specific behavior as to how this is represented.
                                      Generally, proxies should follow the guidance from the RFC:

                                      Name is the name of the HTTP query param to be matched. This must be an
                                      exact string match. (See
                                      https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-2.7.3).


                                      If multiple entries specify equivalent query param names, only the first
                                      entry with an equivalent name MUST be considered for a match. Subsequent
                                      entries with an equivalent query param name MUST be ignored.


                                      If a query param is repeated in an HTTP request, the behavior is
                                      purposely left undefined, since different data planes have different
                                      capabilities. However, it is *recommended* that implementations should
                                      match against the first value of the param if the data plane supports it,
                                      as this behavior is expected in other load balancing contexts outside of
                                      the Gateway API.


                                      Users SHOULD NOT route traffic based on repeated query params to guard
                                      themselves against potential differences in the implementations.

                              this rule.


                              The effects of ordering of multiple behaviors are currently unspecified.
                              This can change in the future based on feedback during the alpha stage.


                              Conformance-levels at this level are defined based on the type of filter:


                              - ALL core filters MUST be supported by all implementations.
                              - Implementers are encouraged to support extended filters.
                              - Implementation-specific custom filters have no API guarantees across
                                implementations.


                              Specifying the same filter multiple times is not supported unless explicitly
                              indicated in the filter.


                              All filters are expected to be compatible with each other except for the
                              URLRewrite and RequestRedirect filters, which may not be combined. If an
                              implementation can not support other combinations of filters, they must clearly
                              document that limitation. In cases where incompatible or unsupported
                              filters are specified and cause the `Accepted` condition to be set to status
                              `False`, implementations may use the `IncompatibleFilters` reason to specify
                              this configuration error.

                                            match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                            to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                            of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".


                                            Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                            matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                            in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                            ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                            match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.


                                            ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                            Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                            the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                                          and "https" to port 443. If the redirect scheme does not have a
                                          well-known port, the listener port of the Gateway SHOULD be used.

                                          Listener port.


                                        Implementations SHOULD NOT add the port number in the 'Location'
                                        header in the following cases:

                                      In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
                                      implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
                                      conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
                                      is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` should be set to
                                      "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.


                                    Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
                                    extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.


                                    If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                                    MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
                                    that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.


                                    Note that values may be added to this enum, implementations
                                    must ensure that unknown values will not cause a crash.


                                    Unknown values here must result in the implementation setting the
                                    Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`, with a
                                    Reason of `UnsupportedValue`.

                                          description: |-
                                            ReplacePrefixMatch specifies the value with which to replace the prefix
                                            match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                            to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                            of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".


                                            Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                            matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                            in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                            ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                            match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.


                                            ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                            Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                            the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                              Matches define conditions used for matching the rule against incoming
                              HTTP requests. Each match is independent, i.e. this rule will be matched
                              if **any** one of the matches is satisfied.


                              For example, take the following matches configuration:


                              ```
                              matches:
                              - path:
                                  value: "/foo"
                                headers:
                                - name: "version"
                                  value: "v2"
                              - path:
                                  value: "/v2/foo"
                              ```


                              For a request to match against this rule, a request must satisfy
                              EITHER of the two conditions:


                              - path prefixed with `/foo` AND contains the header `version: v2`
                              - path prefix of `/v2/foo`


                              See the documentation for HTTPRouteMatch on how to specify multiple
                              match conditions that should be ANDed together.


                              If no matches are specified, the default is a prefix
                              path match on "/", which has the effect of matching every
                              HTTP request.


                              Proxy or Load Balancer routing configuration generated from HTTPRoutes
                              MUST prioritize matches based on the following criteria, continuing on
                              ties. Across all rules specified on applicable Routes, precedence must be
                              given to the match having:


                              * "Exact" path match.
                              * "Prefix" path match with largest number of characters.
                              * Method match.
                              * Largest number of header matches.
                              * Largest number of query param matches.


                              Note: The precedence of RegularExpression path matches are implementation-specific.


                              If ties still exist across multiple Routes, matching precedence MUST be
                              determined in order of the following criteria, continuing on ties:


                              * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp.
                              * The Route appearing first in alphabetical order by
                                "{namespace}/{name}".


                              If ties still exist within an HTTPRoute, matching precedence MUST be granted
                              to the FIRST matching rule (in list order) with a match meeting the above
                              criteria.


                              When no rules matching a request have been successfully attached to the
                              parent a request is coming from, a HTTP 404 status code MUST be returned.

                                          Name is the name of the HTTP Header to be matched. Name matching MUST be
                                          case insensitive. (See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2).


                                          If multiple entries specify equivalent header names, only the first
                                          entry with an equivalent name MUST be considered for a match. Subsequent
                                          entries with an equivalent header name MUST be ignored. Due to the
                                          case-insensitivity of header names, "foo" and "Foo" are considered
                                          equivalent.


                                          When a header is repeated in an HTTP request, it is
                                          implementation-specific behavior as to how this is represented.

                                          exact string match. (See

                                          If multiple entries specify equivalent query param names, only the first
                                          entry with an equivalent name MUST be considered for a match. Subsequent
                                          entries with an equivalent query param name MUST be ignored.


                                          If a query param is repeated in an HTTP request, the behavior is
                                          purposely left undefined, since different data planes have different
                                          capabilities. However, it is *recommended* that implementations should
                                          match against the first value of the param if the data plane supports it,
                                          as this behavior is expected in other load balancing contexts outside of
                                          the Gateway API.


                                          Users SHOULD NOT route traffic based on repeated query params to guard
                                          themselves against potential differences in the implementations.

                        must be specified.


                        The `host` should not refer to a service running in the cluster; use

                        DNS in some apiservers (e.g., `kube-apiserver` cannot resolve
                        in-cluster DNS as that would be a layering violation). `host` may
                        also be an IP address.


                        Please note that using `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` as a `host` is
                        risky unless you take great care to run this webhook on all hosts
                        which run an apiserver which might need to make calls to this

                        to turn up in a new cluster.


                        The scheme must be "https"; the URL must begin with "https://".


                        A path is optional, and if present may be any string permissible in
                        a URL. You may use the path to pass an arbitrary string to the
